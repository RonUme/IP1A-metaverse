# IP1A-metaverse

You can road "InHouse" Scene and play it if you want to see a animal house.
If you push key 'Space', the scene change to "Outside1".
You can see outside view in this scene.
Camera's position is changed by using keys 'w','a','s','d','q','e'.

This project is my first VR project, so CameraMoving Script was wrong.
Camera Object's rotation is not change, so WASD moving is not suitable for this scene.
